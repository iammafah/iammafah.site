## 👋 About

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.

I am **Abdullah Shahid**, a **backend-focused Python developer** who builds
**secure, scalable, and production-ready backend systems**.

This website uses a **lightweight static frontend** to present
**real-world backend projects, APIs, automation systems, and system design thinking**.
All backend services showcased here are developed, deployed, and maintained independently.
